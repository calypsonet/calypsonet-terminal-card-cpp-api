 * Data elements for filtering cards and selecting applications.
 *
 * <p>These elements are of three kinds:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The <b>card protocol</b>, corresponding to the underlying technology: ISO14443-A,
 *       ISO14443-B or any other proprietary or standardized communication technology.
 *   <li>The <b>power-on data</b> pattern.
 *   <li>The <b>selection of the application</b> as defined by ISO7816-4.
 * </ul>
 *
 * These filter elements offered in the card selector, are all optional but can also be combined.
 * <br>
 * If no filtering is specified, any card that responds when inserted in the reader will be
 * considered selected. <br>
 * Conversely, if one or more filters have been defined, the card will not be selected if one of
 * them rejects the card.<br>
 * For the selection by the card protocol, we assume that the reader access layer has provided
 * constants in the form of strings defining the supported protocols. <br>
 * Similarly, for power-on data selection, it is assumed that the reader access layer has provided
 * the structure of the returned data or rules for interpreting it in the form of regular
 * expressions. <br>
 * The selection by DF Name is governed by standardized elements such as the AID and the different
 * values of FileOccurrence, FileControlInformation.
